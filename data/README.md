This folder includes three subfolders: raw, processed, and finalized.
- **raw**: This contains the original heart failure prediction dataset, which we downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction).
- **processed**: This folder contains datasets that have undergone cleaning, imputation, or other preprocessing steps, but are not yet finalized for modeling.
- **finalized**: This folder contains the final version of the dataset used for modeling.
